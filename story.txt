Once upon a time, there was a princess living in the kingdom of Blumund. She 
was very beautiful and rich. She had a dream that one day she would quit
everything in life and sell duck eggs. However, due to the struggles of every
day life, she forgot about the dream.

One day, while walking along the pond bordering her castle she noticed three ducklings whose feathers appeared to be made of pure gold.  She tried to pick one up, but they were extremely heavy.  The princess decided she must find their mother, who might have the gift of laying golden eggs.  She followed the largest prints all the way into the Fire Swamp.

It wasn't a easy journey, and the Fire Swamp turns out to be a gigantic burning swamp. She saw a 2-meter-high duck
with black and crystal-like feathers. She was laying on a golden nest which was surrounded by fierce fire. "She must be the mother", the princess said to herself, "then how can I get through this fire swamp to reach her?"

To get through the burning swamp she gathered the greatest engineers of the land and diverted a nearby river to flow into the fire swamp. With a mighty hiss the fire surrounding the nest was extinguished. Royal knights ran to circle the massive duck, but with a loud honk, it spread its wings and flew away. Inside the nest, a single golden egg remained. The princess brought the egg home to keep until it hatched.
