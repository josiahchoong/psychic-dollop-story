Once upon a time, there was a princess living in the kingdom of Blumund. She 
was very beautiful and rich. She had a dream that one day she would quit
everything in life and sell duck eggs. However, due to the struggles of every
day life, she forgot about the dream.

One day, while walking along the pond bordering her castle she noticed three ducklings whose feathers appeared to be made of pure gold.  She tried to pick one up, but they were extremely heavy.  The princess decided she must find their mother, who might have the gift of laying golden eggs.  She followed the largest prints all the way into the Fire Swamp.
